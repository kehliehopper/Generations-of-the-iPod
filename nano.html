    <li>iPod Nano</li>
        <p>The iPod Nano was a portable media player, designed and formerly marketed by Apple Inc. The first generation model was introducted in 2005, as a replacement
            for the iPod Shuffle, using flash memory for storage. The iPod Nano went through several different generations after its introduction. The Nane is considered
            a shrunken-down iPhone with 16GB of storage, a touchscreen, and a small home button. While it doesn't have a full app store, it offers much more than music.
            You can listen to podcasts, watch videos, and scroll through photos.
