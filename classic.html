    <li>iPod Classic</li>
        <p>The iPod Classic was a portable media player, created and formerly marketed by Apple Inc. There were six generations of the Ipod Classic, as well as a spin-off
            that was later re-intergrated into the main iPod line. This Classic was available in silver or black from 2007 onwards, replacing the "signiture iPod white."
            In 2014, Apple discontinued the iPod Classic. The sixth-generation 160GB iPod Classic was the last Apple product to use the original 30-pin dock connector and
            the distinctive Click Wheel.
