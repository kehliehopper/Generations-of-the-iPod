            The iPod wasn't the first MP3 player, a number of companies had released their version of the MP3 player before Apple unveiled what came to be
            one of its biggest products of the time. However, Apple's iPod was the first truly great MP3 player, and turned it into a must-have device for most people.

            The original iPod didn't have the most storage capacity or the most features, but it did have an insanely simple user interface, great industrial design, and 
            the polish that absolutely defines Apple products. As technology evolved, the iPod evolved with it, often helping to drive innovations and evolutions.
