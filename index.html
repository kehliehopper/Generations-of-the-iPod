            <h1>The iPod Shuffle was a digital audio player designed and formerly marketed by Apple Inc. It was the smallest and most basic iPod and the only iPod with
                 no screen, and was the first iPod to use flash memory. Introduced in 2005, the shuffle was discontinued in 2017. Popular with runners and 
                 people on the go, unites clipped directly onto a sleeve or pocket. Starting with the 3rd-generation model, the VoiceOver text-to-speech feature audibly
                 announced the names of songs, artists, and playlist.
