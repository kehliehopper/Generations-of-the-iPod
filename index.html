        <li>iPod Shuffle</li>
            <p>The iPod Shuffle was a digital audio player designed and formerly marketed by Apple Inc. It was the smallest and most basic iPod and the only iPod with
                 no screen, and was the first iPod to use flash memory. Introduced in 2005, the first generation was discontinued in 2006. Popular with runners and 
                 people on the go, unites clipped directly onto a sleeve or pocket. The First Shuffle plugged directly into the USB port. It was "autofilled" with 240
                 random songs from an iTunes playlist.

        <li>iPod Nano</li>
            <p>The iPod Nano was a portable media player, designed and formerly marketed by Apple Inc. The first generation model was introducted in 2005, as a replacement
                for the iPod Shuffle, using flash memory for storage. The iPod Nano went through several different generations after its introduction. The Nane is considered
                a shrunken-down iPhone with 16GB of storage, a touchscreen, and a small home button. While it doesn't have a full app store, it offers much more than music.
                You can listen to podcasts, watch videos, and scroll through photos.

        <li>iPod Classic</li>
            <p>The iPod Classic was a portable media player, created and formerly marketed by Apple Inc. There were six generations of the Ipod Classic, as well as a spin-off
                that was later re-intergrated into the main iPod line. This Classic was available in silver or black from 2007 onwards, replacing the "signiture iPod white."
                In 2014, Apple discontinued the iPod Classic. The sixth-generation 160GB iPod Classic was the last Apple product to use the original 30-pin dock connector and
                the distinctive Click Wheel.

        <li>iPod Touch</li>
            <p>The iPod Touch is a music player and handhelf gaming device. It was marketed by Apple Inc. With a touchscreen-controlled user interface, it was also used as
                a digital camera, a web browser, and for messaging. It is very similar to the known iPhone, but it connects to the Internet only through Wi-Fi and does not 
                use cellular network data, which is why it is not considered a smartphone. The iPod Touch was introduced in 2007 and by 2012, over 100 million units were sold. 
                iPod touch models are sold by storage space and color. All models of the same generation typically offer identical features, performance, and operating
                systems.

        <li>iPhone</li>
            <p>The iPhone is the first smartphone designed and marketed by Apple Inc. After years of rumors and speculation, it was offically announced in 2007. The
                development of the iPhone as a product began in 2005 and continued in complete secrecy until its public unveiling. The device broke with prevailing mobile
                phone designs by eliminating most physical hardware buttons. The iPhone was one of the first handheld devices to combine a multimedia player, telephone,
                and internet browsing capability on a touchscreen display. It quickly became Apple's bestselling product. The introduction of the App Store on the iPhone
                allowed established companies and startup developers to build careers and earn billions of dollars via the platform, while providing consumers with new 
                ways to access information and connect with other people.
