                <p>The iPhone is the first smartphone designed and marketed by Apple Inc. After years of rumors and speculation, it was offically announced in 2007. The
                    development of the iPhone as a product began in 2005 and continued in complete secrecy until its public unveiling. The device broke with prevailing mobile
                    phone designs by eliminating most physical hardware buttons. The iPhone was one of the first handheld devices to combine a multimedia player, telephone,
                    and internet browsing capability on a touchscreen display. It quickly became Apple's bestselling product. The introduction of the App Store on the iPhone
                    allowed established companies and startup developers to build careers and earn billions of dollars via the platform, while providing consumers with new 
                    ways to access information and connect with other people.
