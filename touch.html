<li>iPod Touch</li>
    <p>The iPod Touch is a music player and handheld gaming device. It was marketed by Apple Inc. With a touchscreen-controlled user interface, it was also used as
        a digital camera, a web browser, and for messaging. It is very similar to the known iPhone, but it connects to the Internet only through Wi-Fi and does not 
        use cellular network data, which is why it is not considered a smartphone. The iPod Touch was introduced in 2007 and by 2012, over 100 million units were sold. 
        iPod touch models are sold by storage space and color. All models of the same generation typically offer identical features, performance, and operating
        systems.
