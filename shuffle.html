            <li>iPod Shuffle</li>
                <p>The iPod Shuffle was a digital audio player designed and formerly marketed by Apple Inc. It was the smallest and most basic iPod and the only iPod with
                     no screen, and was the first iPod to use flash memory. Introduced in 2005, the first generation was discontinued in 2006. Popular with runners and 
                     people on the go, unites clipped directly onto a sleeve or pocket. The First Shuffle plugged directly into the USB port. It was "autofilled" with 240
                     random songs from an iTunes playlist.
